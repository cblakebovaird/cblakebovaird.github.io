      <p>           
            My name is Christopher Blake Bovaird. I was born and raised in Columbus,Ga, where I resided for 26 years 
          before moving to Tennesse and then to my current home in Orlando, Fl. I enjoy moving around a lot because
          it gives me the opportunity to learn different cultures and to gain new perspectives on life. 
          
      </p>

      <p>
          I consider myself to be a Jack of All Trades or a Swiss-Army Knife, in that I have learned many hobbies
          over the years but have never truly mastered one. I can play piano and guitar, but I could not compose
          my own music. I'm great with my bow and arrows, but I do not always hit my mark perfectly. I can speak Spanish
          yet I am not fluent. I can definitely cook, but I would not call myself a chef. I am fully capable of training 
          my own horses, but I fear I might not get far with someone else's. I absolutely love teaching myself new skills
          and as soon as I feel as if I have a pretty good handle on it, I move on to the next one.
      </p>

      <p>
            My hobbies are similar to my skills and range from anything outdoors such as kayaking or hiking to hosting 
            dinner parties and wine tasting events for colleagues. I'm most definitely an adventurer so I absolutely
            love to travel and hope to end up in a career in which I can sometimes work remotely from anywhere in the world. 
            I've always thought that learning coding would be extremely fulfilling and might help me to achieve that 
            goal.

     
      </p>
